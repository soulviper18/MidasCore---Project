MidasCore Project
This repository contains the MidasCore application, developed as part of the JPMC Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage.
It simulates a real-world banking platform workflow, including transaction processing, balance queries, and Kafka-based event streaming.

Features
Spring Boot Backend â€“ RESTful API endpoints for banking operations.

Kafka Integration â€“ Produces and consumes transaction messages.

Mocked REST Services â€“ Used for testing account balance queries.

JUnit & Spring Test â€“ Automated testing with mocked dependencies.

File Loader Utility â€“ Reads transaction data from files and processes them.

Embedded Kafka â€“ Enables integration testing without external dependencies.

Technologies Used
Java 17+

Spring Boot

Spring Kafka

JUnit 5

Maven

Embedded Kafka

MockRestServiceServer
